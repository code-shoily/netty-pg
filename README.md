# netty-pg

My feeble attempt to convert some Netty 4.1 code into Clojure. I don't think they will be Clojuric right away since I am trying to grok how to access Netty with Clojure and get a handle on the Java interop along the way. I know there are amazing stuff like Aleph but my target for this attempt is to play with raw netty as opposed to libraries built on top of it.

## Usage
Well, at the moment only echo server, time server and discard server are created (From the doc; I only had an hour). Many more to come.
